# password-generator ðŸš€

`password-generator` is a tool to generate passwords. It's more of a test for my work in progress Python library for generating passwords though.

To use `password-generator` into your command line and enter:
> (Git is required for the following method.)
```
git clone https://github.com/myferr/password-generator/
```

# Passowo. A Python library ðŸ¦„

Passowo is used for generating passwords using Python that I created! This password generator repo is more of a test of the library, I'm working on adding a bunch of cool features to Passw.

Right now I have:
* `passowo.generate_password()`
* `passowo.generate_letters()`
* `passowo.generate_numbers()`
* `passowo.generate_special_characters()`

As functions for Passowo.

Full documentation and a repo of it will be released once it's done! I also aim towards publishing Passw on `pip` once the library is complete.
